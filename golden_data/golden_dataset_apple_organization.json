      "expert_answer": "Steve Jobs believed that conventional management had stifled innovation. In his first year returning as CEO, he laid off the general managers of all business units (in a single day), put the entire company under one P&L, and combined the disparate functional departments of the business units into one functional organization. This was done to eliminate inter-departmental conflicts over transfer prices and create alignment around a single organizational structure.",

      "expert_answer": "What is remarkable is that Apple has retained its functional structure even though the company is nearly 40 times as large in terms of revenue and far more complex than it was in 1998. Most large corporations would have shifted to a multidivisional structure, but Apple bucked this conventional wisdom. Senior vice presidents remain in charge of functions, not products, and the CEO is still the only position where design, engineering, operations, marketing, and retail of Apple's main products meet.",

      "expert_answer": "Business history and organizational theory, documented by Harvard Business School historian Alfred Chandler, make the case that as entrepreneurial firms grow large and complex, they must shift from a functional to a multidivisional structure. This shift aligns accountability and control and prevents congestion when countless decisions flow up the organizational chart to the top. By the latter half of the 20th century, the vast majority of large U.S. corporations had followed this pattern, which Chandler documented with companies like DuPont and General Motors.",

At Apple, hardware experts manage hardware, software experts manage software, and so on. The rationale is that world-class talent wants to work for and with other world-class talent in their specialty. It is like joining a sports team where you get to learn from and play with the best.

We went out and hired a bunch of professional management. It didn't work at all... They knew how to manage, but they didn't know how to do anything.'

      "expert_answer": "One principle that permeates Apple is 'Leaders should know the details of their organization three levels down,' because this is essential for speedy and effective cross-functional decision-making at the highest levels. If managers attend a decision-making meeting without the details at their disposal, the decision must either be made without the details or postponed.

      "expert_answer": "A 'squircle' is a shape known in the design community that combines continuous curves without abrupt transitions. The standard method for rounding corners uses a circular arc, which creates a somewhat abrupt transition. In contrast, Apple's leaders insist on continuous curves (squircles), where the slope starts sooner but is less abrupt. An advantage of this design is that it produces softer highlights with little to no jump in light reflection along the corner. This example demonstrates Apple's fanatical attention to detail and willingness to commit to extremely precise manufacturing tolerances to execute on such subtle design choices.",

These teams included: silicon design, camera software, reliability engineering, motion sensor hardware, video engineering, core motion, and camera sensor design, among others.

      "expert_answer": "Early attempts at portrait mode produced amazing photos but also 'failure cases' where the algorithm could not distinguish between the central object (like a face) and the background. For example, if a person was photographed behind chicken wire, the algorithm could not blur the wire in the background while keeping the wire in front sharp. This violated Apple's strict engineering standard of zero 'artifacts' (undesired alterations in data). The design and marketing leaders joined the debate and brought an artistic perspective, looking at great portrait photographers' work and noting they often had blurring at face edges but sharpness on eyes. This helped establish a new quality standard that was both technically sound and artistically acceptable.",
      "source_page": "9",
      "source_passage": "The first attempts produced some amazing portrait pictures but also a number of 'failure cases' in which the algorithm was unable to distinguish between the central object in sharp relief (a face, for instance) and the background being blurred...

The design leaders brought an additional artistic sensibility to the debate, asking, 'What makes a beautiful portrait?'",

      "expert_answer": "Accountability without control means you are accountable for making a project succeed even though you don't control all the other teams needed for that success. For example, while Graham Townsend is accountable for how great the camera is, he needed dozens of other teams (each with their own commitments) to contribute to the portrait mode project. This process can be messy, but when done with a shared purpose it creates 'good mess.' 'Bad mess' occurs when teams push their own agendas ahead of common goals. This model works because it forces effective collaboration and ensures projects succeed through coordinated effort rather than hierarchical control.",

Tim Cook's recent adjustments include: (1) dividing the hardware function into hardware engineering and hardware technologies, (2) adding artificial intelligence and machine learning as a separate functional area, and (3) moving human interface out of software to merge it with industrial design, creating an integrated design function.

      "expert_answer": "The discretionary leadership model is Apple's response to the challenge of maintaining its leadership approach (experts leading experts, immersion in details, and collaborative debate) at an ever-greater scale. As Apple has grown from 17,000 employees in 2006 to 137,000 in 2019, senior leaders now head larger and more diverse teams, making it impossible to know every detail. The model teaches leaders to exercise discretion about where to spend their time, dividing their responsibilities into four categories: owning (40%), learning (30%), teaching (15%), and delegating (15%). This preserves Apple's fundamental principle of aligning expertise with decision rights while enabling growth.",

This contrasts with the conventional principle of a business unit structure, which aims to align accountability and control. At Apple, those with the most expertise and experience in a domain should have decision rights for that domain.
