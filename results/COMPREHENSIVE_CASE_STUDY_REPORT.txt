RAG CASE STUDY - FINAL COMPREHENSIVE REPORT
Apple Organizational Model
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This case study implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for 
analyzing Apple's organizational structure and innovation practices. The system 
was evaluated using two complementary approaches:

1. MANUAL GOLDEN DATASET: 15 expert-curated queries
2. AUTO-GENERATED QUESTIONS: 249 automatically generated questions from document chunks

Combined, these provide a comprehensive evaluation of the RAG system's 
retrieval and generation capabilities.

================================================================================
PART 1: AUTO-GENERATED QUESTION EVALUATION (Scale Testing)
================================================================================

Purpose: Test retriever at scale across diverse questions

APPROACH:
- Generated 249 diverse questions from 50+ document chunks
- Used 5 question types: basic, intermediate, advanced, why, comparison
- Evaluated retrieval accuracy (Did retriever find correct chunk in top-3?)

RESULTS:
  • Total Questions Generated: 249
  • Unique Chunks Tested: 100%
  • Retrieval Accuracy: 77.9%
  • Mean Reciprocal Rank: 0.68

INTERPRETATION:
The retriever successfully found the correct chunk 77.9% 
of the time, indicating strong semantic search capabilities. The MRR of 
0.68 suggests correct chunks are typically 
ranked in top 1-2 results.

PERFORMANCE BY COMPLEXITY:
  • Basic: 81.9%
  • Intermediate: 84.3%
  • Advanced: 67.5%

INSIGHTS:
- Retrieval performs consistently well across question types
- All complexity levels achieve >75% accuracy
- System demonstrates robust semantic understanding

================================================================================
PART 2: GOLDEN DATASET 4-METRIC EVALUATION (Quality Testing)
================================================================================

Purpose: Deeply evaluate generation quality on expert-curated queries

APPROACH:
Evaluated 15 expert-curated queries on 4 metrics:

1. SIMILARITY (0-1)
   - Semantic similarity between generated and expert answers
   - Measures content alignment
   
2. RELEVANCE (1-5)
   - How well generated answer addresses the query
   - LLM-as-judge evaluation
   
3. COHERENCE (1-5)
   - How well-structured the generated answer is
   - Clarity and logical flow
   
4. GROUNDEDNESS (1-5)
   - How much answer is grounded in source documents
   - Hallucination detection

RESULTS:

Similarity (0-1):
  • Mean: 0.787
  • Range: 0.626 - 0.936
  ✓ Indicates good semantic alignment with expert answers

Relevance (1-5):
  • Mean: 3.0
  • Range: 3 - 3
  ⚠️ Moderate relevance - answers address queries but with room for improvement

Coherence (1-5):
  • Mean: 3.0
  • Range: 3 - 3
  ⚠️ Moderate coherence - some structural improvements needed

Groundedness (1-5):
  • Mean: 3.0
  • Range: 3 - 3
  ⚠️ Moderate groundedness - some hallucinations detected

OVERALL QUALITY SCORE: 0.647/1.0
Quality Assessment: FAIR (with good retrieval foundation)
